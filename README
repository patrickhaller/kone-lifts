KONE lifts run a linux-based controller with PostgreSQL as a back-end. 

The data collected allows us to make more informed decisions regarding people flow 
in our buildings, provided we have the right analytics. 


SUPPORTED QUESTIONS:

How many people did one of our lift groups move during a time window? Assuming
body size as percentage of lift load, and mean distance travelled, we have:

elink_stat=# select * from  lift_group_moved('Grp9', '2016-08-17 11:20:00', '2016-08-17 11:35:00');
 lift_group | people
------------+--------
 Grp9       | 499.75
